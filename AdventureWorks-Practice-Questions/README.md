# About AdventureWorks Database  

## Introduction 

- The `AdventureWorks` database is a sample database originally created for **Microsoft SQL Server (2008-2014)** to demonstrate standard **Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)** scenarios for a fictional bicycle manufacturer, **Adventure Works Cycles**.  
- Since the original database was built for SQL Server, to use it with **PostgreSQL**, we need to perform specific steps to convert and set it up in a compatible format.
- For the database documentation, visit [Datedo](https://dataedo.com/samples/html/AdventureWorks/doc/AdventureWorks_2/home.html)

## Requirements  

Before starting, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:  

1. **PostgreSQL:** Follow the installation process [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to get the database server
2. **psql:** the CLI tool which usually included by default when installing PostgreSQL. Confirm its installation by running the command 

    ```bash
    psql --version
    ```
3. **pgAdmin4:** A GUI for PostgreSQL which can be installed following the instructions [here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)  

**Note:** 
   - While the **psql** tool will be used to set up the database, the execution of the queries that answer the questions will be run on **pgAdmin4**'s query tool. This is because I find its graphical interface intuitive as it will allow us to easily connect to PostgreSQL instances, visualize the database objects (tables, views, functions, and so on), export and import data. 
   - Anyway, you can still use **psql** if you wish to, pick your poison!
 

## Operating System Notes  

- For this project, I used a Linux OS. However, you can take note of the following based on your OS:
   - **Linux:** The commands provided above work directly on Linux terminals. Just ensure PostgreSQL, Ruby, and required scripts are installed as per the instructions.  
   - **Windows:** For Windows systems, use **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and ensure Ruby and PostgreSQL are in the system path. Alternatively, install a Bash-compatible terminal such as Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).  
   - **macOS:** macOS users can use the default **Terminal** application to run the same commands. Ensure Ruby is installed via **Homebrew**:  

         ```bash
         brew install ruby
         ```

## Setting Up AdventureWorks in PostgreSQL  

### Step 1: Download AdventureWorks Database  

1. Visit the Microsoft SQL Server Samples [GitHub page](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks-oltp-install-script.zip) and download the **AdventureWorks 2014 OLTP Script**.  
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file where you will find several **CSV files** inside.


### Step 2: Convert AdventureWorks for PostgreSQL  

- To set up `AdventureWorks` database in PostgreSQL, we will use the scripts provided in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres) to convert the SQL Server data into a PostgreSQL-compatible format.
- The scripts of particular interest are: 
   1. [install.sql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres/master/install.sql)  
   2. [update_csvs.rb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres/master/update_csvs.rb)  


### Step 3: Preparing the CSV Files  

1. Once the scripts are installed, place them in the same folder with the extracted CSV files from Step 1. You can rename the folder to your liking
2. Open a terminal (CLI) in that folder and run the following command to modify the CSV files:  

   ```bash
   ruby update_csvs.rb
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up a Server in pgAdmin4

1. Launch pgAdmin4 and under the `Quick Links` section click the `Add New Server` button
2. Under the `General` tab of the `Register - Server` pop up window, add a name of your liking to the `Name` input box. In my case I called it "SampleTest".
3. Go to the `Connection` tab and add the host name or address as `localhost` and input your password (toggle on the `Save password` button if you like). I'll leave other options with the default value and 
4. Click `Save` and this should lead you to a window like the one one below
5. Using the psql CLI we'll create a new database (as shown in the Step 5) in addition to the `postgres` database already available, which we'll leave untouched

### Step 5: Create and Set Up the Database  

- Use the following `psql` command to connect to PostgreSQL, to create the database and tables, import the data, and set up the views and keys:  

      ```bash
      psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE \"AdventureWorks\";"
      psql -U postgres -d AdventureWorks -f install.sql
      ```

      - Note that you may be prompted to enter a password depending on how you've configured your `postgres` user in the `pg_hba.conf` file
      - The `-U postgres` flag ensures that we connect to the PostgreSQL default superuser (administrator account) `postgres` that is created when PostgreSQL is installed
      - If you get any error, check out the internet for solutions

   psql -U postgres -c "\l"

## Verifying the Setup  
 -  Once the setup is complete, you can list all tables in the database by running the following commands:

      1. Open psql query tool

         ```bash
         psql -U postgres
         ``` 
      2. Connect to `AdventureWorks` database to check if all the 68 tables are properly set up and the 11 out of 20 views are established (views dependent on XML functions are excluded). 

         ```sql
         \c "AdventureWorks"
         \dt (humanresources|person|production|purchasing|sales).*
         ```

- Alternatively, you can go to the pgAdmin4 interface and refresh the server by right clicking the `Servers` option to locate the `Refresh...` option and checking if the database and its objects are correctly set in the `Schema` option where you are suppose to 11 schemas


## Using pgAmin4's Query Tool

1. With the `AdventureWorks` database and its relevant object's created, right click on it and select the "Query Tool" option where we will write our queries
   - To execute every command in the script, press the button `1` (shown in the image), or press `F5` in your keyboard
   - To execute just a single command, press button `2` (shown in the image), or press `alt + F5` in your keyboard
   - To save the script in the Query Tool, press button `3` (shown in the image), or press `ctrl + s` in your keyboard

Everything from now on will then use pgAdmin GUI, but you are welcomed to use the CLI psql.


## Source of Inspiration

üìö The questions solved in these exercises were taken from the book *Real SQL Queries: 50 Challenges* by Brian Cohen, which can be accessed either from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Real-SQL-Queries-50-Challenges/dp/1517290708) or [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/333677601/Real-SQL-Queries-50-Challenges-Brian-Cohen)  
üéØ I chose the book because, unlike most SQL books, it comes with 50 practical problems and their solutions. The challenges are not overly simplistic, making them ideal for SQL enthusiasts looking to refine their skills  
üí° While the book provides solutions, it does not explain the reasoning behind them, and the style can sometimes make it easy to lose track of the mechanics. This inspired me to not only adapt the challenges for **PostgreSQL** but also provide additional context for the questions and the reasoning behind each solution  
üìå I'd also like to bring to your attention the difference in some of the data input such as the data referred to in the text and those that I use in the solution given that the database went through an update between the time of publishing the textbook and when the database was update  
üßë‚Äçüíª The availability of the script to convert the database from SQL Server-based to PostgreSQL was also a huge motivator. Thanks [Lorin Thwaits](https://github.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres) for the amazing job  
üßë‚ÄçüíªFor those specifically looking for SQL Server solutions, I found this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shrutichen86/SQL-Queries/blob/master/Real%20SQL%20Queries%2050%20Challenges.txt) to be a useful resource
